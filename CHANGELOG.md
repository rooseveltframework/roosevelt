# Roosevelt Changelog

## Next version

- Breaking: `port` is now `http.port` and changed the default to `43763`.
- Breaking: `https.force` was removed in favor of `http.enable`.
- Breaking:  `authInfoPath`, `passphrase`, `caCert`, `requestCert`, and `rejectUnauthorized` have all been removed from `https` and replaced with `options` where you can pass any [native option](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions).
  - The `ca`, `cert`, `key`, and `pfx` params can take file paths relative to your secretsDir in addition to everything else natively supported (strings, buffers, and arrays of strings or buffers).
  - The file paths get resolved within arrays if you pass arrays to any of those as well.
- Breaking: `NODE_PORT` env var now sets https port when https is enabled and falls back to http if https is disabled.
- Breaking: Moved the versioning of webpack from Roosevelt itself to the app.
- Changed default of `preprocessedViewsPath` param from `'mvc/.preprocessed_views'` to `'.build/.preprocessed_views'`.
- Changed default of `preprocessedStaticsPath` param from `.preprocessed_statics'` to `'.build/.preprocessed_statics'`.
- Updated various dependencies.

## 0.26.1

- Added new Express variable `debugMarkup` that contains HTML you can add to your custom error pages if you define any that will print server errors if any exist, display the route list, add some inline JavaScript that will serialize the request's `err`, `req`, and `res` objects so you can interactively examine them in the browser's developer tools. Only available in development mode.
- Added the aforementioned debug markup to the default error pages in development mode as well.
- Added `routes` Express variable which will list all routes in the app.
- Added new recognized environment variable: `MAKE_BUILD_ARTIFACTS` will allow you to set Roosevelt's `makeBuildArtifacts` config.
- Added new param `minifyHtmlAttributes`: Settings to pass to [minify-html-attributes](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/minify-html-attributes).
  - Options:
    - `enable`: Whether or not to enable `minify-html-attributes`.
      - Default: *[Boolean]* `false`.
      - Available options:
        - `'production'`: Enable only in production mode.
        - `'development'`: Enable in all modes.
        - `true`: Will be taken to mean `'production'`.
    - `minifyHtmlAttributesParams`: Params to pass to [minify-html-attributes](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/minify-html-attributes).
      - Default: *[Object]* `{}`
  - Default: *[Object]*
    ```json
    {
      "enable": true,
      "minifyHtmlAttributesParams": {}
    }
    ```
  - Note: Roosevelt will always override 3 params from [minify-html-attributes](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/minify-html-attributes):
    - `htmlDir` will always be set to Roosevelt's `preprocessedViewsPath`.
    - `cssDir` will always be set to Roosevelt's `preprocessedStaticsPath`.
    - `jsDir` will always be set to Roosevelt's `preprocessedStaticsPath`.
- Added new param `preprocessedStaticsPath`: Relative path on filesystem to where your preprocessed static files will be written to. Preprocessed static files are view files that have been preprocessed by the [minify-html-attributes](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/minify-html-attributes) module, if you have `minifyHtmlAttributes` enabled.
  - Default: *[String]* `".preprocessed_statics"`.
  - This feature will only be active if `minifyHtmlAttributes` is enabled.
- Replaced `isomorphicControllers` param with `clientControllers` param and made it function similarly to `clientViews`.
- Fixed a bug with displaying app version on default error pages.
- Fixed a bug that could lead to a counter-intuitive error if your template rendered an empty response in dev mode.
- Updated various dependencies.

## 0.26.0

- Breaking: Added new param `preprocessedViewsPath`: Relative path on filesystem to where your preprocessed view files will be written to. Preprocessed view files are view files that have had their uses of web components progressively enhanced using the [progressively-enhance-web-components](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/progressively-enhance-web-components) module.
  - Default: *[String]* `"mvc/.preprocessed_views"`.
  - To disable this feature, set the value to `false`.
  - This is breaking because if you leave it enabled by default (recommended), you will need to add `.preprocessed_views` to your `.gitignore`.
- Breaking: Switched to external source maps for the CSS preprocessor. This necessitated changing the custom CSS preprocessor API to require returning an object instead of a string.
  - If you have written a custom CSS preprocessor, the new return value is:
    ```javascript
    return {
      css: 'write code to output css here',
      sourceMap: 'write code to output source map here (optional)'
    }
    ```
- Added new param `prodSourceMaps` to allow source maps to be generated in prod mode for both CSS and JS.
- Added IP address to the output when the server starts.
- Added new CLI script `secretsGenerator.js` that allows you to combine `certsGenerator.js`, `csrfSecretGEnerator.js`, and `sessionSecretGenerator.js` into one command.
- Added feature to override `appDir` and `secretsPath` for the CLI scripts using `--appDir somewhere` and `--secretsPath somewhere` CLI flags.
- Added `exceptionRoutes` option to the `frontendReload` param.
- Added a check for broken symlinks in the public folder, which will be purged if any exist.
- Added support for placing your Roosevelt config in a `roosevelt.config.json` file in addition to the previous options.
- Added better error when attempting to start a Roosevelt app on a file system that does not support symlinks.
- Changed source maps from inline to external.
- Fixed a bug that caused the JS bundler to not log when it was writing JS files.
- Fixed a bug that caused a `statics/pages` directory being created when it isn't needed.
- Fixed a bug that could cause the public folder and statics folder to be created even when `makeBuildArtifacts` is disabled.
- Fixed a bug that caused the views bundler and isomorphic controllers finder to write a new views bundle to disk even when it wasn't needed.
- Fixed `frontendReload` not working in Firefox with the default HTTPS config.
- Updated various dependencies.

## 0.25.0

- Breaking: Supplying an `allowlist` to the views bundler will now implicitly disable `exposeAll`.

## 0.24.0

- Breaking: Altered `startServer` and `initServer` methods to now be async. They now need to be awaited to avoid possible race conditions.
  - As a result, starting the app in a single line needs to be updated to `await (require('roosevelt').startServer())`.
  - Callback arguments have been removed from these methods as well.
- Breaking: Removed `app.get('routes')`, `onReqAfterRoute`, `onReqBeforeRoute`, `onReqStart`, and `onStaticAssetsGenerated`.
- Breaking: Renamed `app.httpServer` to `app.get('httpServer')` and `app.httpsServer` to `app.get('httpsServer')`.
- Breaking: Added `enable` param to `clientViews`. If your app uses the `clientViews` feature, you will need to add this param to continue using the feature.
- Added new method `onBeforeMiddleware`.
- Added `start` and `stop` method shorthands for `startServer` and `stopServer` respectively.
- Refactored various things under the hood to improve code quality, performance, and reduce unnecessary dependencies.

- Updated various dependencies.

## 0.23.1

- Added feature that scans the router stack to move the 404 route (the `*` route) to the end of the stack every time a new route is added, even if the route is added at runtime so that you can dynamically add routes while the app is running.
- Updated various dependencies.

## 0.23.0

## 0.22.0

- Breaking: Added a unified `secrets` directory for various app secrets such as HTTPS certs, session secret, CSRF secret, etc. The name of the directory is configurable, but when upgrading an app from the previous version, you may need to alter your rooseveltConfig to remove directories from your `cert` or `key` paths. You must now specify only a file name in those params.

- Fixed a bug that would cause roosevelt-router to produce a false negative when detecting teddy.
- Various dependencies updated.

## 0.21.10

  - `localhostOnly` and `alwaysHostPublic` defaults were flipped to false and true respectively.
  - `alwaysHostPublic` was renamed to `hostPublic`.
  - The `--host-public` command line flag was removed, since it is no logner needed because `hostPublic` defaults to true now.
  - New command line flag added called `production-proxy` to let you opt-in to `localhostOnly` and `alwaysHostPublic` being set to true and false respectively as before.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.18.3

- You can now [use PHP as your templating engine](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/node-php-runner) in a Roosevelt app or any other Express application. PHP should be faster than any JS-based templating engine for complex templates since its parser is written in C rather than JS.

It is also recommended that you remove all references to old build artifacts such as `.build` and `.bundled` in your application as well from package.json, .gitignore, etc.**
- Eliminated concept of separate JS compilers in favor of declaring this via your webpack config. Note: webpack defaults to minifying JS using terser.

- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.15.0

- Moved CSS minification from [roosevelt-less](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt-less) to Roosevelt using `clean-css` as a direct dependency. The `clean-css` library had an update with breaking changes so the `rooseveltConfig` params in `advanced` and `aggressiveMerging` in `cleanCSS` are now outdated.
- New default script `npm run proddev`: Runs the app in production mode, but with the public folder hosted by the Roosevelt app. This is useful for doing development in production mode without having to stage a complex simulation of your production environment, which would likely include hosting static files via another web server better-suited to serving statics like Apache or nginx.
- Roosevelt now sources configs internally using [source-configs](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/source-configs).
- Validator will now be disabled if `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` are set but localhost is not in `NO_PROXY`.
- Fixed a bug where not having `devDependencies` or `dependencies` objects in your app's package.json would throw errors when installing dependencies. Accordingly re-reverted most changes in 0.14.1 to fix buggy behavior with `devDependencies` in npm installs.
- The `check-dependencies` call will now only apply to production dependencies.
- Some internal refactoring to clean things up.
- Various dependencies bumped.
