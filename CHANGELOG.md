# Roosevelt Changelog

## Next version

- Breaking change: Moved css minification from roosevelt-less to Roosevelt using clean-css as a direct dependency. The clean-css library had an update with breaking changes so the rooseveltConfig params in "cleanCSS", 'advanced' and 'aggressiveMerging', are now outdated

## 0.14.6

- Fixed a bug that caused `devDependencies` of Roosevelt to be removed if `npm i` was run more than once.
- Fixed a bug that caused the automated testing to break if your clone of Roosevelt was not named "roosevelt."
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.5

- `staticsSymlinksToPublic` will now create missing subdirectories necessary to create a symlink in a target location.
- Fixed a bug which caused Java hs_err_pid error logs to pile up in your app directory under certain conditions.
- Fixed a bug which caused frontend reload to not work on the various error pages.
- Added code comment above frontend reload script tag to explain that it is injected by Roosevelt.
- Did some copyediting on frontend reload logging.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.4

- Added automatic browser reloading when your frontend code changes (via [reload](https://github.com/alallier/reload)).
- A console warning will now appear explaining why public static assets don't load in prod mode when alwaysHostPublic is set to false (the default).
- New Express variable added: `routes` containing a list of all routes loaded in the application.
- Various dependencies bumped.
- CI improvements.

## 0.14.3

- Restored move of several things to devDependencies to shrink production builds. Feature is now activated using `ROOSEVELT_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable. There are also new corresponding `npm run` commands `dev-install` and `dev-prune` to manage this. See README for more details.
- Copyediting on several logs to improve clarity.
- Various dependencies bumped.
- CI improvements.

## 0.14.2

- Reverted most changes in 0.14.1 to fix [#713](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt/issues/713), but preserved modularization of htmlValidator.js so that if any devDependencies are missing, the app will not crash in production mode.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.1

- Moved several things to devDependencies to shrink production builds.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.0

- Replaced internal logger with [roosevelt-logger](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt-logger). Note: this removes the `winston` Express variable that was previously provided, but it is still indirectly accessible by drilling down through the `logger` Express variable now. See [roosevelt-logger member variable documentation](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt-logger#properties-of-roosevelt-logger-module).
- If custom routers are being used, the `res.redirect()` method will now prepend the prefix to redirects that are relative to the hostname. To override this setting pass `true` as the last argument.
- HTML validator `exceptions` param will now accept an array of values instead of just a single string value.
- Various dependencies bumped.
- CI improvements.

## 0.13.0

- Roosevelt will now warn you if your CSS/JS compile directory is getting stale and might need to be cleaned with `npm run clean`. A new `cleanTimer` param has been added to configure or disable this check.

- Added new feature to create custom CSS/JS preprocessors on the fly.
- Added environment variable to enable/disable the HTML validator autokiller.
- Added OpenJDK support to the Java HTML Validator.
- Various dependencies bumped.
- CI improvements.
