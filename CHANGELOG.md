# Roosevelt Changelog

## Next version

- Put your changes here...

## 0.19.0

- Breaking: Production mode behavior [changed significantly](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt/issues/934):
  - `localhostOnly` and `alwaysHostPublic` defaults were flipped to false and true respectively.
  - `alwaysHostPublic` was renamed to `hostPublic`.
  - The `--host-public` command line flag was removed, since it is no logner needed because `hostPublic` defaults to true now.
  - New command line flag added called `production-proxy` to let you opt-in to `localhostOnly` and `alwaysHostPublic` being set to true and false respectively as before.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.18.3

- You can now [use PHP as your templating engine](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/express-php-view-engine) in a Roosevelt app or any other Express application. PHP should be faster than any JS-based templating engine for complex templates since its parser is written in C rather than JS.
- Breaking: blacklist/whitelist params throughout the API have been renamed to blocklist/allowlist.
- README was copyedited to improve the clarity of the default behaviors of some of the API, remove outdated information, and other small improvements.
- The host-public warning was made more prominent so that production mode default behavior regarding statics is less confusing to people.
- CI improvements.
  - Breaking: Roosevelt is no longer tested on Node 10.x. We didn't do anything to explicitly break older Node versions, but use at your own risk.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.18.2

## 0.16.0

- Replaced browserify with webpack. **This has significant breaking API changes.

It is also recommended that you remove all references to old build artifacts such as `.build` and `.bundled` in your application as well from package.json, .gitignore, etc.**
- Eliminated concept of separate JS compilers in favor of declaring this via your webpack config. Note: webpack defaults to minifying JS using terser.

## 0.15.1

- Fixed bug causing apps to crash in dev mode.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.15.0

- Moved CSS minification from [roosevelt-less](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt-less) to Roosevelt using `clean-css` as a direct dependency. The `clean-css` library had an update with breaking changes so the `rooseveltConfig` params in `advanced` and `aggressiveMerging` in `cleanCSS` are now outdated.
- New default script `npm run proddev`: Runs the app in production mode, but with the public folder hosted by the Roosevelt app. This is useful for doing development in production mode without having to stage a complex simulation of your production environment, which would likely include hosting static files via another web server better-suited to serving statics like Apache or nginx.
- Roosevelt now sources configs internally using [source-configs](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/source-configs).
- Validator will now be disabled if `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` are set but localhost is not in `NO_PROXY`.
- Fixed a bug where not having `devDependencies` or `dependencies` objects in your app's package.json would throw errors when installing dependencies. Accordingly re-reverted most changes in 0.14.1 to fix buggy behavior with `devDependencies` in npm installs.
- The `check-dependencies` call will now only apply to production dependencies.
- Some internal refactoring to clean things up.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.6

- Fixed a bug that caused `devDependencies` of Roosevelt to be removed if `npm i` was run more than once.
- Fixed a bug that caused the automated testing to break if your clone of Roosevelt was not named "roosevelt."
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.5

- `staticsSymlinksToPublic` will now create missing subdirectories necessary to create a symlink in a target location.
- Fixed a bug which caused Java hs_err_pid error logs to pile up in your app directory under certain conditions.
- Fixed a bug which caused frontend reload to not work on the various error pages.
- Added code comment above frontend reload script tag to explain that it is injected by Roosevelt.
- Did some copyediting on frontend reload logging.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.4

- Added automatic browser reloading when your frontend code changes (via [reload](https://github.com/alallier/reload)).
- A console warning will now appear explaining why public static assets don't load in prod mode when alwaysHostPublic is set to false (the default).
- New Express variable added: `routes` containing a list of all routes loaded in the application.
- Various dependencies bumped.
- CI improvements.

## 0.14.3

- Restored move of several things to devDependencies to shrink production builds. Feature is now activated using `ROOSEVELT_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable. There are also new corresponding `npm run` commands `dev-install` and `dev-prune` to manage this. See README for more details.
- Copyediting on several logs to improve clarity.
- Various dependencies bumped.
- CI improvements.

## 0.14.2

- Reverted most changes in 0.14.1 to fix [#713](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt/issues/713), but preserved modularization of htmlValidator.js so that if any devDependencies are missing, the app will not crash in production mode.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.1

- Moved several things to devDependencies to shrink production builds.
- Various dependencies bumped.

## 0.14.0

- Replaced internal logger with [roosevelt-logger](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt-logger).

See [roosevelt-logger member variable documentation](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt-logger#properties-of-roosevelt-logger-module).
- If custom routers are being used, the `res.redirect()` method will now prepend the prefix to redirects that are relative to the hostname. To override this setting pass `true` as the last argument.
- HTML validator `exceptions` param will now accept an array of values instead of just a single string value.
- Various dependencies bumped.
- CI improvements.

## 0.13.0

- Roosevelt will now warn you if your CSS/JS compile directory is getting stale and might need to be cleaned with `npm run clean`. A new `cleanTimer` param has been added to configure or disable this check.
- Added new param `routers` to add support for [Express Routers](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#express-router).
- Added new feature to create custom CSS/JS preprocessors on the fly.
